# A Simple Weather Aapp
This is project from The Odin Project. The main goal was learning to use API's and asynchronous functions. 
The design was inspired by Nami, a character from the anime and manga, One Piece. Her association with weather and bright, cheerful colour pallette felt like a perfect addition to this project.
